Change Log
----------

These are notable changes in edx-platform.  This is a rolling list of changes,
in roughly chronological order, most recent first.  Add your entries at or near
the top.  Include a label indicating the component affected.

Common: Add tests for documentation generation to test suite

Blades: User answer now preserved (and changeable) after clicking "show answer" in choice problems

LMS: Users are no longer auto-activated if they click "reset password"
This is now done when they click on the link in the reset password
email they receive (along with usual path through activation email).

LMS: Problem rescoring.  Added options on the Grades tab of the
Instructor Dashboard to allow a particular student's submission for a
particular problem to be rescored.  Provides an option to see a
history of background tasks for a given problem and student.

Blades: Small UX fix on capa multiple-choice problems.  Make labels only
as wide as the text to reduce accidental choice selections.

Studio: Remove XML from the video component editor. All settings are
moved to be edited as metadata.

XModule: Only write out assets files if the contents have changed.

XModule: Don't delete generated xmodule asset files when compiling (for
instance, when XModule provides a coffeescript file, don't delete
the associated javascript)

Studio: For courses running on edx.org (marketing site), disable fields in
Course Settings that do not apply.

Common: Make asset watchers run as singletons (so they won't start if the
watcher is already running in another shell).

Common: Use coffee directly when watching for coffeescript file changes.

Common: Make rake provide better error messages if packages are missing.

Common: Repairs development documentation generation by sphinx.

LMS: Problem rescoring.  Added options on the Grades tab of the
Instructor Dashboard to allow all students' submissions for a
particular problem to be rescored.  Also supports resetting all
students' number of attempts to zero.  Provides a list of background
tasks that are currently running for the course, and an option to
see a history of background tasks for a given problem.

LMS: Fixed the preferences scope for storing data in xmodules.

LMS: Forums.  Added handling for case where discussion module can get `None` as
value of lms.start in `lms/djangoapps/django_comment_client/utils.py`

Studio, LMS: Make ModelTypes more strict about their expected content (for
instance, Boolean, Integer, String), but also allow them to hold either the
typed value, or a String that can be converted to their typed value. For example,
an Integer can contain 3 or '3'. This changed an update to the xblock library.

LMS: Courses whose id matches a regex in the COURSES_WITH_UNSAFE_CODE Django
setting now run entirely outside the Python sandbox.

Blades: Added tests for Video Alpha player.

Common: Have the capa module handle unicode better (especially errors)

Blades: Video Alpha bug fix for speed changing to 1.0 in Firefox.

Blades: Additional event tracking added to Video Alpha: fullscreen switch, show/hide
captions.

CMS: Allow editors to delete uploaded files/assets

XModules: `XModuleDescriptor.__init__` and `XModule.__init__` dropped the
`location` parameter (and added it as a field), and renamed `system` to `runtime`,
to accord more closely to `XBlock.__init__`

LMS: Some errors handling Non-ASCII data in XML courses have been fixed.

LMS: Add page-load tracking using segment-io (if SEGMENT_IO_LMS_KEY and
SEGMENT_IO_LMS feature flag is on)

Blades: Simplify calc.py (which is used for the Numerical/Formula responses); add trig/other functions.

LMS: Background colors on login, register, and courseware have been corrected
back to white.

LMS: Accessibility improvements have been made to several courseware and
navigation elements.

LMS: Small design/presentation changes to login and register views.

LMS: Functionality added to instructor enrollment tab in LMS such that invited
student can be auto-enrolled in course or when activating if not current
student.

Blades: Staff debug info is now accessible for Graphical Slider Tool problems.

Blades: For Video Alpha the events ready, play, pause, seek, and speed change
are logged on the server (in the logs).

Common: all dates and times are not time zone aware datetimes. No code should create or use struct_times nor naive
datetimes.

Common: Developers can now have private Django settings files.

Common: Safety code added to prevent anything above the vertical level in the
course tree from being marked as version='draft'. It will raise an exception if
the code tries to so mark a node. We need the backtraces to figure out where
this very infrequent intermittent marking was occurring. It was making courses
look different in Studio than in LMS.

Deploy: MKTG_URLS is now read from env.json.

Common: Theming makes it possible to change the look of the site, from
Stanford.

Common: Accessibility UI fixes.

Common: The "duplicate email" error message is more informative.

dropped suddenly.
