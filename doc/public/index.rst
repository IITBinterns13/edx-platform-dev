    Public facing docs for non-developers go here. Please do not add any Python
    dependencies for code introspection here (we may temporarily host it some
    place where those dependencies are cumbersome to build).

edX Data Documentation
======================
The following documents are targetted at those who are working with various data formats consumed and produced by the edX platform -- primarily course authors and those who are conducting research on data in our system. Developer oriented discussion of architecture and strictly internal APIs should be documented elsewhere.

Course Data Formats
-------------------
These are data formats written by people to specify course structure and content. Some of this is abstracted away if you are using the Studio authoring user interface.

Internal Data Formats
---------------------
These document describe how we store course structure, student state/progress, and events internally. Useful for developers or researchers who interact with our raw data exports.
