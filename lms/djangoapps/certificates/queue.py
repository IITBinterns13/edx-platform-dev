    XQueueCertificateInterface provides an
    interface to the xqueue server for
    managing student certificates.

    Instantiating an object will create a new
    connection to the queue server.

    See models.py for valid state transitions,
    summary of methods:

       add_cert:   Add a new certificate.  Puts a single
                   request on the queue for the student/course.
                   Once the certificate is generated a post
                   will be made to the update_certificate
                   view which will save the certificate
                   download URL.

       regen_cert: Regenerate an existing certificate.
                   For a user that already has a certificate
                   this will delete the existing one and
                   generate a new cert.


       del_cert:   Delete an existing certificate
                   For a user that already has a certificate
                   this will delete his cert.
